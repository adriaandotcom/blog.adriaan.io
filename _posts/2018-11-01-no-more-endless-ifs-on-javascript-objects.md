title: End to the endless if's to get a JavaScript value in (nested) objects
---

> **UPDATE**: I created [a better blog post](/replacement-for-optional-chaining-of-nested-objects-in-js.html) without the use of `eval`

Sometimes you have to get a variable from a nested object like this

```js
const customer = {
  sources: {
    data: [{
      type: 'card',
      last4: '1234'
    }]
  }
}
```

If you want to get the value `1234`, you could do this:

```js
const { last4 } = customer.sources.data[0]
```

But if you don't know if the whole object will be there (like with this Stripe response), you'll need to check for every variable:

```js
let last4
if (customer
  && customer.sources
  && customer.sources.data
  && customer.sources.data[0]
  && customer.sources.data[0].last4) {
    last4 = customer.sources.data[0].last4
}
```

Or you could do a `try...catch`:

```js
let last4
try {
  last4 = customer.sources.data[0].last4
} catch (error) {
  // do nothing
}
```

But I like to have a little function that does this for me:

```js
// Copy this function
const get = (object, selector) => {
  try {
    if (typeof object !== 'object') return
    return eval(`object.${selector}`)
  } catch (error) {
    return
  }
}

// So you can do
const { last4 } = get(customer, 'sources.data[0]')
```

There is a relevant [proposal by tc39](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-optional-chaining) (thanks [@TehShrike](https://x.com/TehShrike/status/1058093341861179393)).
