title: Disable Firefox Account / Sync
---

Firefox has a feature where they want you to register for. It's Firefox Account. Sometimes called Firefox Sync. It's something I don't like to do, it's a browser and it doesn't need to know who I am. That's why I disabled the Firefox Account feature including the button and tab in settings.

Here is how:

1. Open `about:config` and search for `identity.fxaccounts.enabled` of copy paste this into your address bar `about:config?filter=identity.fxaccounts.enabled`
2. Double click to toggle to **false**
3. Restart Firefox
